# Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)

This repository contains scripts that allow users to conduct paramater studies for certain crownet simulations (../../crownet/crownet/simulations/).
Python>=3.12 is required.


## Run the simulations
### From terminal

We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment
```
source ../../out/crownet_user/bin/activate

```
Change to the simulation directory and run the script.
