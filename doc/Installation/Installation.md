# Installation

Setting up a simulation machine with the CrowNet environment is quite simple. You simply clone this CrowNet repository, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and start the three containers.

## Required Hard- and Software

The CrowNet environment requires a Linux System. We are currently using Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS but any major distribution should do, since the required dependencies are all part of the respective Docker containers. A system with 8 GB of RAM is recommended.

## Repo setup

Clone the CrowNet repository including all submodules within your home directory. 
```
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/roVer-HM/crownet.git
```
Note: if you are a developer, clone the gitlab repository instead: 
```
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@sam-dev.cs.hm.edu:6000/rover/crownet.git
```

Install Docker (if not already available on your system):
```
cd crownet/scripts
install_docker.sh
```

Configure CrowNet by running (do not overwrite the pre-configured images tags unless you provide the respective images yourself):
```
cd ..
source setup
```
Get the required Docker images (due to the large size of some of them, this will take some time - depending on your Internet connection):
```
./scripts/get_images
```
We recommended to include 'source ${CROWNET_HOME}/setup -i' in the startup file of your shell (~/.bashrc). 

Notes:
* The start script will mount your home directory so that it is visible inside the Docker container. 
* The OMNeT++ IDE uses the workspace directory to store its preferences and development artifacts.
* Disable SELinux (Fedoara, RedHat, ...) with `sudo setenforce 0` for the installation, since it blocks X11 Forwarding. 

### For developers only
Please follow our [coding style instructions](./CodingStyle.md), and see our [recommendations](./Recommendations.md).

## Build CrowNet 

You can either build each [component individually](BuildOfIndividualSubModules.md) or use the top-level Makefile.
The simplest way to build the system is to use the top-level Makefile which we descrive in the following.
Preserving the required build-order, the top-level Makefile builds all the required components.
Simply run:

```
omnetpp exec make makefiles
omnetpp exec make make=release
```

Notes:
* the flag "release" forces "release" mode. To switch to "debug" mode, use "debug".
* the number of available processor cores are auto-detected during the build process and a sufficient number of threads is started.

That's all - now you can change to [simulations](../../crownet/simulations) and start running the simulations.

## Quick start

This quick start example demonstrates how to simply run a CrowNet simulation.
Please find more detailed information on how to run CrowNet simulations in our [documentation](../Running-a-Simulation/README.md)

### Step 1: Start the mobility container

Start the sumo and/or vadere container by executing the respective start script:
```
$> sumo
/bin/bash -c "cd /home/vm-sts; /init.sh "
Welcome to the roVer sumo Docker Container.

Using TRACI_PORT='' TRACI_GUI='false'

If you want to start sumo-gui manually, you can do this via docker exec:
  docker exec sumo sumo-gui
Listening on port 9999
```
or 
```
$> vadere
used image: sam-dev.cs.hm.edu:5023/rover/crownet/vadere:latest
/bin/bash -c "cd /home/vm-sts; /init.sh "
Welcome to the roVer vadere Docker Container.

Using TRACI_PORT='' TRACI_GUI='false' TRACI_DEBUG='' VADERE_LOG_LEVEL=''  VADERE_LOG=''

To launch vadere-gui call vadere exec vadere-gui
Vadere 1.15 (Commit Hash: 05e16522ef78086194e58fee6c713cb713faa6f7) [TraCI: VadereTraCI-20.0.2 This is a TraCI Server implementing only a small subset of TraCI Version 20]
INFO:root> vadere launcher listening on port 9998 ..
```

The container will now be listening for incoming TraCi commands and start mobiliy simulator. The 
TraCI port for sumo defaults to `9999` and for vadere to `9998`.

### Step 2: Start the omnetpp container and open workspace
Start the omnetpp container:
```
omnetpp-ide
```
Setup the Omnet++ IDE as described [here](../Running-a-Simulation/StartUp-GUI.md) and build the project in release or debug mode.

### Step 3: Run the simulation
Got to `crownet/simulations/testSim` in the project view and search for the `omentpp.ini` file.
Run the simulation by doing a right-click and selecting "Run as OMNeT++ simulation". When the simulation GUI is visible, 
select one of the following configurations and start the simulation:

1. vadere_test001 ("requires that you started the vadere container as described above")
2. sumo_crossing_peds ("requires that you started the sumo container as described above")
3. sumo_crossing_peds_cars ("requires that you started the sumo container as described above")
4. test_control00* ("requires that you started the vadere and the flowcontrol container")

Note: 
* See crownet/simulations/networks/default_configs.ini for common settings such as traci host and port setup.
