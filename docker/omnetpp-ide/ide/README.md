# Eclipse IDE for OMNeT++

This directory contains the base IDE that is required in order to run OMNeT++.
It is not included in the OMNeT++ repository but delivered as part of the
OMNeT++ source tar archive on the website. 

If you compile OMNeT++ based on the sources in the roVer gitlab repository, the
files in the ide.tar.gz archive need to be extracted to ./ide in the omnetpp
directory. 

The files are downloaded an cached locally and not part of the repo. See `../update_containers.sh` for currently used version.

## Version
Version has been extracted from the OMNeT++ Version 6.0pre11 and is Java 11 compatible
