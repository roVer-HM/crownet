/**
 * Only log signals after a given fixed interval. Use the ResultFilter as normal
 * and add the attribute 'interval_par' which points to a double value parameter of
 * the module containing the statistic.
 * This allows the configuration of different intervals for different statistics
 * and there configuration over the ini files.
 *
 * Example:
 * @statistic[posX](source="xCoord(mobilityPos(simTimeIntervalFilter(mobilityStateChanged)))"; interval_par="positionStatInterval"; record=vector?);
 * @statistic[posY](source="yCoord(mobilityPos(simTimeIntervalFilter(mobilityStateChanged)))"; interval_par="positionStatInterval"; record=vector?);
 * double positionStatInterval = default(0.4);
 *
 * Log position every 400ms.
