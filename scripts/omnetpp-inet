# Start script for the omnetpp-inet container.
# In addition to the omnetpp simulation environment, this container includes the
# projects inet, simulte and veins.
#
# By default, the latest version will be started. In order to start a different version
# add the version number as first argument. For example: "omnetpp 5.3" will start
# a containter with the 5.3 release. For a list of available containers, refer to the
# docker registry or the wiki of the project.
#
# Furthermore, the script can be called with the parameter "exec" and a specific
# command to be executed within the container.
#
# Examples:
#
# "omnetpp"		will start the OMNeT++ IDE in the latest OMNeT++ container
# "omnetpp 5.3"		will start the OMNeT++ IDE in the OMNeT++ 5.3 container
# "omnetpp exec ls"	will start the command "ls" in the latest OMNeT++ container
# "omnetpp 5.3 exec ls"	will start the command "ls" in the OMNeT++ 5.3 container
